                    <i>Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library</i> (SMBL) is a digital enhancement
                     of William Wright's <i>Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the
                        British Museum acquired since the year 1838</i> (London, 1870-1872),

                        in partnership with the British Library as an open access online resource.
                        Using new methods of digital representation, SMBL enables users to engage with the

                <h1 class="top-padding-sm">Review Panel and Online Workshop: Call for Participants</h1>
                <p>
                    Syriaca.org is pleased to call for editorial review panelists to assist in the publication of <i>Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library: A New Digital Edition of Wright’s Catalog</i>, a digital enhancement of William Wright's <i>Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Museum</i> published by Syriaca.org in partnership with the British Library. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new database is an open-access online resource designed to help users search and rearrange the manuscripts according to multiple criteria, many of which were not central to Wright’s system of organization (e.g. chronology, additions, marginalia, scribes, or forms of decoration).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Panelists will be invited to participate in a two-week online workshop hosted by The Digital Lab at Vanderbilt University during the weeks of June 3-7, 2024, and July 8-12, 2024. Honoraria for participants will be paid by a grant from Vanderbilt University’s Office of the Vice Provost for Research &amp; Innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We invite graduate students, independent scholars, researchers, librarians, and faculty members with expertise in Syriac Studies to serve as editorial review panelists who will review and revise the data and test the database. All collaboration will be done remotely, and we welcome applications from scholars in any location, if they can join the project using online tools.
