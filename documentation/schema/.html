                        <p>Welcome to the encoding guidelines for  <span>Syriac Manuscripts in the
                            British Library: A New Digital Edition of Wright’s Catalogue</span>.
                        These guidelines describe the methodology used to create  <a href="https://www.tei-c.org">TEI</a>  XML files for describing Syriac
                        manuscripts according to the schema implemented by Syriaca.org in the
                        project  <a href="https://bl.syriac.uk"><span>Syriac Manuscripts in the
                                British Library</span></a>. For the moment, these guidelines
                        cover only the description rather than the transcription of manuscripts.
                        Syriaca,org hopes to expand these guidelines to include transcription in the
                        future. We have chosen to use the TEI guidelines because they allow both a
                        high level of detail and flexibility. We anticipate that this schema can be
                        easily adapted for other Syriac manuscript catalogues and we invite comments
                        and suggestions for improvement. 
                        </p>
                
                     </div>

                        <h3 class="head div">Acknowledgements</h3>
                     
                        <p>These guidelines are based on the following sources. The general editors
                        began by following the encoding guidelines for the  <a href="https://www.fihrist.org.uk/"><span>Fihrist Union Catalogue of
                                Manuscripts from the Islamicate World</span></a>  and the  <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:21f5f0f8-3dac-4977-a7c1-dff494ac5851"><span>ENRICH TEI P5 ODD</span></a>, which were then modified by
                        Syriaca.org into a  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/175Yx1uf_HaXRA6O36p83vf-ECFWLGFNbUXoDF7ffVDs"><span>Syriaca TEI for MSS Manual (now deprecated)</span></a>.
                        In many cases, we reproduced the Fihrist guidelines verbatim. In turn these
                        earlier encoding guidelines were updated in 2024 to be largely compatible
                        with the  <a href="https://github.com/msDesc/consolidated-tei-schema"><span>Consolidated TEI P5 Customization and Encoding Guidelines
                                for Manuscript Description</span></a>  for western medieval
                        manuscripts jointly created by Cambridge University Library (James Freeman,
                        with Suzanne Paul) and the Bodleian Library (Matthew Holford) with
                        contributions by Andrew Dunning (formerly British Library) and James
                        Cummings. When applicable, we have reproduced the consolidated guidelines
                        verbatim in our own guidelines. (Those consolidated guidelines in turn draw
                        in places on earlier western medieval manuscript guidelines created by
                        Patrick Granholm and Eva Nyström for  <a href="https://www.manuscripta.se/"><span>manuscripta.se</span></a>.)

                     </div>

                        <h3 class="head div">General Principles</h3>
                     
                        <p>It is essential to note that we have customized these guidelines specifically
                        for use in digitally encoding the manuscript descriptions made by William
                        Wright in his  <span>Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British
                            Museum</span>  (3 vols., 1870-1872). Due to this specialized use, these
                        guidelines do not include all possible TEI XML features which might be
                        desired either for cataloguing Syriac manuscripts or for medieval
                        manuscripts in general. For example, because Wright does not provide
                        detailed descriptions ofthe modern custodial history of the manuscripts we
                        have not utlized those features in these guidelines. Similarly, because the
                        main language of Wright's catalogue is English, these guidelines assume that
                        each file will have English as its main language.
                        </p>
                     
                        <p>In addition, we have followed the guidelines below with the assumption that
                        the resulting XML files for the  <a href="https://bl.syriac.uk"><span>Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library</span></a>
                        project (hereafter  <span>SMBL</span>) will be displayed using the custom
                             <a href="https://srophe.app/"><span>Srophe App</span></a>
                        developed by Syriaca.org. We have also made an effort to ensure
                        compatibility (as much as possible) with the HTML tools and transformations
                        developed for the  <a href="https://github.com/msDesc/consolidated-tei-schema"><span>Consolidated TEI P5 Guidelines for Manuscript
                                Description</span></a>.

                           <p><a href="https://bl.syriac.uk"><span>Syriac Manuscripts in the
                                    British Library: A New Digital Edition of Wright’s
                                    Catalogue</span></a>  has been concieved of as a digital
                            representation of William Wright's catalogue.  <span>SMBL</span>  is not
                            intended to be a revision of Wright or a re-cataloguing of the
                            manuscripts themselves. For the vast majority of manuscripts described
                            in this project, we (the editors of  <span>SMBL</span>) have reproduced
                            Wright's prose verbatim without verifying his descriptions against the
                            manuscripts. While that level of comparison is beyond the scope of this
                            present project, we hope that the digital encoding of
                                 <span>SMBL</span>  might serve as a foundation for such a new
                            cataloguing effort in the future.
                           </p>
                         
                           <p>In general we make no claims about the reliability of Wright's
                            descriptions as reproduced in  <span>SMBL</span>. Because our goal was
                            to encode Wright's catalogue as written, we have reproduced his
                            attributions of authorship and his dating of the manuscripts, even in
                            cases where these may now be disputed or revised by subsequent
                            scholarship. We, ofcourse, agree that such an update to his catalogue
                            would be valuable in the future.  <span>SMBL</span>  is published under
                            an open access license and we would be delighted to collaborate with any
                            interested scholars in such a future update. Such a revision, however,
                            needs a base text as a starting point, hence our decision to encode
                            Wright's catalogue "as is" in the first edition of
                             <span>SMBL</span>.
                           </p>
                         
                           <p>Even with the stated goal of verbatim reproduction, we have had to make a
                            few editorial interventions during the course of encoding. In most
                            casese, these interventions were necessitated by the precision of
                            encoding which required us to make explicit some data which Wright may
                            have left implicit or imprecise in his prose. These interventions have
                            occured in the following primary cases (each of which follow the
                            principles of Wright's own descriptions):  
                              <ul>
                                 <li>When our editors have found a clear typographical or internal
                                    inconsistency in Wright's descriptions, we have corrected these
                                    errors for the sake of clarity.</li>
                                 <li>When our editors have discovered inconsistency in Wright's
                                    identification of codicological units, we have further divided
                                    single shelfmarks into further manuscript parts in a method
                                    similar to that used by Wright himself. Most often our editorial
                                    interventions in this regard have been to identify fly-leaves as
                                    separate manuscript fragments when Wright may have grouped them
                                    together. These new codicological divisions are identifiable
                                    because they will share the same roman numeral from Wright's
                                    print catalogue but each have a different URI.</li>
                                 <li>When Wright has lapsed from his usually methodical listing and
                                    numbering of manuscript items, we have attempted in some cases
                                    to adapt Wright's prose back to the form of a list of manuscript
                                    contents. For example, we have frequently made this editorial
                                    intervention when Wright has chosen to describe the undertext of
                                    a palimpsest in a paragraph rather than an as an outline of
                                    contents.</li>
                              </ul>  Finally,  <span>SMBL</span>  has made one further type of modern
                            editorial intervention in Wright's prose. In the century and a half that
                            have passed since Wright wrote, scholarly values concerning the
                            preservation of cultural heritage have changed profoundly. In some
                            cases, Wright's descriptions reflect his prejudices as a European
                            scholar in the nineteenth century. Because  <span>SMBL</span>  is an
                            open access resource widely available on the internet, we did not wish
                            to reproduce Wright's prose without context. Accordingly, in some places
                            in which Wright expressed pejorative or other derogratory opinions, we
                            have added an editorial note to indicate that these opinions do not
                            reflect the opinions of the editors of  <span>SMBL</span>  nor do they
                            represent the approach of contemporary scholars in the field of Syriac
                            studies. ]

                           <p>Editorial notes made by  <span>SMBL</span>  related to the various
                            interventions described above have been encoded with the  <span class="tei-gi">note</span>
                            element with  <span class="tei-att">type</span>  of  <span class="tei-q">editorial</span>. This  <span class="tei-att">type</span>
                            distinguishes these editorial notes from notes made by Wright himself
                            which are either without any  <span class="tei-att">type</span>  or marked as
                                 <span class="tei-att">type</span>  of  <span class="tei-q">footnote</span>. An example of an modern
                            editorial note is as follows: <span class="tei-egXML">
                                <span class="tei-note">

                            </span></p>
                    
                        </div>
                     
                        <div>
                         
                           <h3 class="head div">References to Locations within a Manuscript</h3>
                         
                           <p>References to a specific location or range of folia within a manuscripts
                            are given in a  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  element which can be inserted within a
                            number of different elements. The  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  element marks the
                            location of the parent element’s material within the manuscript and thus
                            should be nested within the element it modifies. Typically the
                                 <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  will refer to a folio or a range of folio numbers
                            within the manuscript. When describing folio numbers, it is our policy
                            to follow Wright's usage and use  <span class="tei-q">a</span>  to refer to the recto of a
                            folio, and  <span class="tei-q">b</span>  to refer to the verso. Where Wright does not specify
                            recto or verso, we encoded a folio number without  <span class="tei-q">a</span>  or  <span class="tei-q">b</span>.
                            In prose, there should always be a whitespace between the folio number
                            and the  <span class="tei-q">a</span>  or  <span class="tei-q">b</span>. But in attribute values, there should be
                            no whitespace, e.g.  <span class="tei-q">232b</span>: <span class="tei-egXML"><span class="tei-locus">Fol. 232
                                    b</span></span>
                        
                           </p>
                         
                           <p>A text node (eg.  <span class="tei-q">foll. 21 a-22 b</span>) is not required for many uses of
                                 <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  (such as when it is used nested in an
                             <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>), but least one attribute value must also be encoded
                            with every  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>, either  <span class="tei-att">from</span>  or  <span class="tei-att">to</span>  or
                            both. (Since Wright's catalogue does not often give ending ranges, the
                                 <span class="tei-att">to</span>  occurs less in the data). These attribute values may
                            be used in the future to enable links to folio images or calculation of
                            lengths of manuscript items. Frequently in Wright’s catalogue the
                            beginning location of a manuscript item is given, but not the ending
                            location. In this situation, our policy is to record only the listed
                            opening location in Wright’s catalogue as the beginning of the range in
                            the attribute  <span class="tei-att">from</span>. We do not supply a  <span class="tei-att">to</span>
                            attribute unless Wright has indicated on what folio the msItem ends, for
                            example by citing an  <span class="tei-gi">explicit</span>  or  <span class="tei-gi">finalRubric</span>. 
                           </p>
                         
                           <p>The following examples illustrate common uses of  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>. Whenever
                            possible, the designation folio/folia and their abbreviations were
                            included in the text node of  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>. as in the exampls below.
                            (Please be aware that Wright uses "Fol." for a single folio and "Foll."
                            for a range of folia. We adapt Wright's capitalization of based on
                            context. If "Fol." stands alone in a list it is capitalized. If "fol."
                            occurs in the middle of other prose it is capitalized according to the
                            rules of the sentence.):<span class="tei-egXML">

                           <p>Deprecated Practices and Legacy Data:</p>
                         
                           <p>As a legacy of an earlier encoding model, the  <span>SMBL</span>  data
                            contains some folio ranges encoded as numerals in  <span class="tei-att">to</span>  without
                            "a" or "b". In this earlier data model, we attempted to deduce the end
                            of ranges for manuscript items when not specified by Wright. Similarly
                            when Wright's prose indicated that his description applied only to a
                            single folio (for example when describing a marginal note), our policy
                            was previously to list that location in both  <span class="tei-att">from</span>  and
                                 <span class="tei-att">to</span>  attributes. After 2022, we ceased to encode in this
                            way. While we have left these estimates in the data, documents revised
                            since 2022 longer add estimated data in this way.

                           <p>In  <span>SMBL</span>  we have assumed that  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  refers to a
                            folio or folio range unless otherwise indicated. Accordingly, we do not
                            use the  <span class="tei-att">scheme</span>  attribute to indicate the foliation scheme
                            except in cases where the  <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  refers to something other than
                            a folio, such as a column.

                           <p>In these authority files, each entity is an individual abstract concept
                            identified by a unique URI. For example, the person known as Ephrem the
                            Syrian is identified by the URI:  <a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a>  and the city of Edessa where he
                            spent much of his life is identified as  <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a>. The necessity of using unique
                            strings of characters instead of traditional names arises from the
                            occurrence of homonymous entities. For example,  <span>The Syriac
                                Gazetteer</span>  has entries for 69 different churches and
                            monasteries each with the name  <span class="tei-q">Mar George</span>. Accordingly, all
                            Syriaca.org URIs are unique—each identifying only one conceptual entity.
                            Thus, every  <span class="tei-q">Church of Mar George</span>  is assigned a separate URI.
                           </p>
                         
                           <p>Syriaca.org URIs are not merely random strings of text and numbers; they
                            are HTTP URIs, meaning that each URI is also a URL (a Uniform Resource
                            Locator, e.g. an HTTP address). Thus, Syriaca.org’s URI for Ephrem the
                            Syrian,  <a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a>, is also a valid HTTP address.
                            The benefit of using HTTP URIs is that these URIs are
                                 <span class="tei-q">self-descriptive</span>  in that each URI is also an HTTP link to a
                            web document describing or defining the concept identified by the URI.
                            Although perhaps obvious to state, the web document which is returned
                            from a Syriaca.org URI is only a definition of the concept named by the
                            URI, not the entity itself (thus the address  <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a>  does not allow one to download
                            the real-world city of Edessa, but a web page describing that
                            city!).
                           </p>
                         
                           <p>In the Syriaca.org data model, each URI represents a conceptual thing
                            with a mental existence related to, but not reducible to, its historical
                            or physical manifestation. Syriaca.org adopted this broad definition so
                            that mythological and other ahistorical persons, places, and concepts
                            can be assigned URIs. For example, the concept identified by the URI
                                 <a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a>  identifies not only the
                            historical person Ephrem the Syrian, but also the supra-historical
                            hagiographical and pseudepigraphal traditions about him. Following this
                            same logic, any historical concept can be described in the Syriaca.org
                            URI model, even if its historical existence was only in the cultural
                            imaginary.

                           <p>The Syriaca.org authority files and URIs are central to the data model of

                              <p>In some files we may have previously over-normalized the spelling of
                                author names compared to what Wright provides (e.g., changing Jacob
                                of Batnae to Jacob of Serugh). We now wish to revert these changes,
                                so please check and restore the name spelling as Wright provides it.

                              <p>Our policy is to report the names in the same prose given by Wright.
                                In a future update of  <span>SMBL</span>, we may also provide a
                                uniform name where the spelling or name used by Wright is no longer
                                commonly used in scholarship. A few examples of these are already
                                present in our data in the form below (where the "supplied"

                                Encoders should not enter these "uniform" names as they will be

                                tagged in one of two methods.

                                    <li>When the title is identifying the intellectual contents of

                                is incomplete, so we have not required references to URIs for works
                                in  <span>SMBL</span>. When possible we have included URIs
                                published in  <a href="https://syriaca.org/nhsl/index.html"><span>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature
                                </span></a>. A URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier which is a
                                unique identifying number for each literary work (as a conceptual
                                entity). References to URIs for literary works, (using either
                                     <span class="tei-gi">title</span>  or  <span class="tei-gi">ref</span>) are marked up in an attribute
                                value. For  <span class="tei-gi">title</span>  the URI is placed in a  <span class="tei-att">ref</span>
                                attribute. For the element  <span class="tei-gi">ref</span>  the URI is placed in a
                                     <span class="tei-att">target</span>  attribute. For example the URI  <a href="https://syriaca.org/work/1">http://syriaca.org/work/1</a>  identifies the book of Genesis

                                Accordingly, we have only encoded URIs for bibliographic citations
                                when available. Currently we rely on two sources of URIs. Some
                                citations are linked with uris of the format
                                     <span class="tei-q">http://syriaca.org/bibl/8</span>  from Syriaca.org. Others are
                                marked with URIs from The Comprehensive Bibliography on Syriac
                                Studies of the format

                                In a future development, all of these citation URIs will be merged
                                to a format of  <span class="tei-q">http://syriaca.org/cbss/WMADLJWW</span>.

                                LETTER RIGHT HALF RING (for aleph) and U+02BF ʿ MODIFIER LETTER LEFT
                                HALF RING (for ʿayin, respectively). You can cut and paste most of
                                these characters from the list  <a href="https://github.com/srophe/syriaca-data/wiki/Transliteration-and-Vocalization-Standards">here</a>. In some cases you may find the characters $ or % in
                                the text. These were used in an early stage to mark where to enter
                                non-Roman text. $ indicates Syriac text should be entered. In most
                                cases you should check to see if the Syriac is complete, most likely
                                it was entered but this character was not deleted, if so you may
                                delete it. If needed, add the missing Syriac and then delete. The %
                                character was used to indicate that text in Arabic, Greek, Armenian
                                or other non-Roman script should be entered. If you are able, enter
                                that text as described above. Lastly, when you find that the PDF of
                                Wright's catalogue contains either images or special characters
                                which cannot be displayed using Syriac or Greek unicode fonts,
                                please open a GitHub issue, apply the label "cannot display", and
                                include this message in the title of your issue: “PDF contains
                                characters or images which cannot be displayed in XML.” Note: This

                            find the changes you made and proofread them. If you are not able to

                            we can make the change later. (For example, if you do not work in
                            Arabic, do not add Arabic text. Or for example, if the Syriac characters
                            needed in the document do not exist in unicode fonts and cannot be added
                            create an issue noting this). Note: This section is provided for the

                        <p>All manuscript description takes place in the  <span class="tei-gi">msDesc</span>  element which
                        is contained in a parent  <span class="tei-gi">sourceDesc</span>  element. Within  <span class="tei-gi">msDesc</span>
                        and its descendent elements is all the information about the manuscript as a
                        physical object, its constituent parts, and intellectual works represented
                        within.
                        </p>
                     
                        <p>All manuscript descriptions must be informed by attention to codicological
                        units. In other words, whether the manuscript was created in one place, over
                        one period of time, or is a composite of parts from multiple sources,
                        assembled at a later date. In the case of the Syriac manuscripts in the
                        British Library, it is often the case that manuscripts which were originally
                        physically distinct, are now bound together. In such cases, multiple
                        codicological units can be found sharing a single shelfmark.  <a href="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/1">Add. 12,133</a>  is an example of
                        one binding containing multiple manuscripts.
                        </p>
                     
                        <p>If the manuscript forms a single codicological unit, its intellectual
                        content, physical description, and history are described directly under the
                             <span class="tei-gi">msDesc</span>  element.

                        <p>If the manuscript comprises  <a href="#msPart">multiple codicological
                            units</a>, each unit has been described in a separate  <span class="tei-gi">msPart</span>
                        element, and only information common to the whole manuscript is described
                        directly under the  <span class="tei-gi">msDesc</span>  element in this manner:  <span class="tei-egXML">

                            </span>
                        </span>  As show above, the  <span class="tei-gi">msDesc</span>  element should always have a

                        according to the pattern manuscript-(URI number). For mult-part manuscript,
                        the  <span class="tei-gi">msPart</span>  element will also have an  <span class="tei-att">xml:id</span>  and an
                             <span class="tei-att">n</span>  created from the number of the manuscript part.

                           <p>The Syriac manuscripts in the British Library have had a number of
                            variant indentifiers. Not only can the current shelfmarks be expressed
                            with or without commas (Add. 12,178 or Add. 12178) or the prefixes
                                 <span class="tei-q">Additional</span>,  <span class="tei-q">Add</span>. or  <span class="tei-q">MS</span>, but Wright also
                            assigned roman numerals to his entries which have been widely used in
                            later scholarship. One goal of publishing  <span>SMBL</span>  is to
                            create permanent URIs to facilitate easier citation of the manuscripts
                            in digital databases. Accordingly,  <span>SMBL</span>  has assigned a
                            URI as the primary identifier encoded in the  <span class="tei-gi">idno</span>  in the
                                 <span class="tei-gi">msIdentifier</span>. Using these URIs, the  <span class="tei-gi">msIdentifier</span>
                            in each file looks similar to this example from Add. 12,178 which is URI

                                    of the items in the hierarchy of items and sub-items. This
                                    sequential number is relative to the manuscript part. Thus a

                                     <span>SMBL</span>  has not used Wright's outline numbering
                                    system, but instead has re-numbered the manuscript items
                                    sequentially. While there is some loss to not continuing to use
                                    Wright's numbering, we found the re-numbering to be necessary
                                    for two reasons. First, the sequential numbering allows one to
                                    navigate the nested elements much easier than Wright's system
                                    (where the same manuscript could potentially have repeated
                                    numbers due to outline levels). Second, in our encoding we
                                    occaisionally discovered manuscript items which Wright had
                                    conflated. The need to number these items necessitated
                                    re-numbering.

                                 <p>We have followed the definition proposed by the Consolidated
                                    Guidelines where a manuscript item is defined as  <span class="tei-q">a complete
                                        work or item, or a self-contained part of a larger work with
                                        (potentially) independent circulation</span>. A
                                         <span class="tei-q">self-contained part of a larger work</span>  could be a
                                    letter in a letter-collection, or a sermon in a homiliary; it
                                    could also represent the biblical text or the commentary in a
                                    glossed biblical manuscript.
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>As a guiding principle, where possible and practicable we have
                                    used the  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  element to markup up both the work as a
                                    whole its self-contained parts through the nesting of
                                         <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  elements. In a few cases (primarily with
                                         <span class="tei-foreign">florilegia</span>  or  <span class="tei-foreign">catenae</span>)
                                    is has not been possible to encode individual manuscript items
                                    based on Wright's descriptions. In those cases, we have placed
                                    his descriptions into  <span class="tei-gi">note</span>  elements.

                                    <p>For the most part, Wright's catalogue employs an sequential
                                        outline pattern that describes manuscript items and their
                                        sub-items in a way compatible with the TEI Guidlines. In a
                                        few cases, however, we have had to modify Wright's outlines
                                        to better model the manuscript in the tree structure of the
                                        .xml file. Specifically, in some instances we have had to
                                        create a new top-level manuscript item which contains all of
                                        the items in a manuscript. Often in such cases, Wright
                                        provided a title and description of this top-level item, but
                                        he did not include this item in his numbered outline. At
                                        other times, we have found Wright's outline to be partial or
                                        incomplete. For example, Wright might only list some but not
                                        all of the sub-items in a manuscript. In these cases, our
                                        policy has been to encode only the sub-items that Wright
                                        mentions. In these cases, our .xml document matches Wright's
                                        description but not the actual contents of the manuscript
                                        (of course, we hope the a future recataloguing will capture
                                        the contents which Wright did not describe in detail). The
                                        examples below illustrate what this might look like.</p>

                                    <p>In an earlier stage of the project, we did attempt to create
                                        placeholder  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  elements for content not
                                        described by Wright so some files do contain sub-items with
                                        minimal description which were not found in Wright's
                                        description. We discontinued this practice after 2022 but
                                        have left the legacy data in place, since it may be of use
                                        to future cataloguing.

                                    <p>While Wright usually describes the manuscript contents in a
                                        methodical manner creating an outline sequentially in order
                                        from the first folio to the last, there are places where he
                                        abandons this approach and offers a prose description of the
                                        contents that does not follow the order of the document. In
                                        the most frequent example, Wright may choose to describe a
                                             <span class="tei-foreign">florilegium</span>  in a manner organized by
                                        alphabetically by author cited rather than by folio order.
                                        In this modified example from  <a href="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/265">https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/265</a>, Wright offers
                                        an alphabetical list:  <span class="tei-quote" dir="ltr" lang="en">“The authorities cited are--Didymus of

                                            to Timothy, fol. 19 b; to Titus, fol. 27 b. Epiphanius:
                                            the Ancoratus. Fol. 26 a. Ephraim: foll. 21 a, 25 a, 30
                                            a, 31 b;”</span>. Wright's description does not offer
                                        enough information to encode individual manuscript items. In
                                        those cases, we have placed these descriptions into one or
                                        more  <span class="tei-gi">note</span>  elements with the following XPath: msItem/note/p.
                                        Inside this  <span class="tei-gi">note</span>, we have encoded as much of the
                                        relevant information about authors, titles, and loci as
                                        possible. As illustrated in this modified example from  <a href="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/265">https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/265</a>: <span class="tei-egXML">

                                 <p>We have given the starting folio of each manuscript item
                                    according to the guidelines specified above for  <a href="#locus"><span class="tei-gi">locus</span></a>. If Wright does not
                                    give a folio location for a  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>, we have added one
                                    using the closest folio that he mentions in his description,
                                    even though this may not be very accurate. For example if Wright
                                    mentions an msItem on folio 12 b and then fails to give a locus
                                    for the next msItem, we have reused the locus so that both items
                                    are listed as being on 12 b.
                                 </p>

                                    inside the  <span class="tei-gi">author</span>  element and wrapped with a
                                         <span class="tei-gi">persName</span>  child element (with  <span class="tei-att">xml:lang</span>

                                    discussion of URIs, all  <span class="tei-gi">author</span>  elements are required to
                                    have a Syriaca.org person URI as the value of a  <span class="tei-att">ref</span>,
                                    For anonymous works, no  <span class="tei-gi">author</span>  was included in the

                                    encoded as given without standardization. Where Wright records

                                 <p>Within the  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>, we have used the  <span class="tei-gi">title</span>
                                    element to encode the descriptive titles which Wright gives for
                                    each manuscript item. These descriptive titles are usually in
                                    English, though occaisionally in Latin or a mixture of
                                    languages. These are not standardized titles and at times can be
                                    very long sentence or paragraph type titles (as was more common
                                    in 19th-century English) as in this example:  <span class="tei-egXML">
                                        <span class="tei-msItem">
                                            <span class="tei-title" xml:lang="en" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fragments of the second volume of
                                                the Commentary of Daniel of Salach on the Psalms,
                                                viz. part of the homilies on Pss. li., lviii., and
                                                lxii </span>
                                        </span>
                                    </span>  We have made every effort to encode these titles
                                    exactly as written by Wright, though in some cases we have made
                                    silent emmendations for grammar or when Wright's prose was not
                                    clear. One change we have made throughout is to capitalize the
                                    first word of each title. More notably, if Wright's title was
                                    abbreviated due to context, we have supplied additional words to
                                    make the context clear. In addition, in the cases where Wright
                                    did not supply an English title we have constructed one so that
                                    every  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  has a non-Syriac title (usually in
                                    English) to appear in search and browse results (see discussion
                                         <a href="#noEnglishTitle">below</a>).
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <p>As can be seen in the example just given (<span class="tei-q">Fragments of the
                                        second volume of the Commentary of Daniel of Salach on the
                                        Psalms, viz. part of the homilies on Pss. li., lviii., and
                                        lxii</span>), many manuscript items are themselves composed of
                                    sub-items. In these cases, we have taken advantage ofthe tree
                                    structure of the XML encoding since it is possible to infinitely
                                    nest  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  elements inside of parent  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>
                                    elements. Thus in many cases a manuscript may contain one parent
                                         <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  to which Wright has given a general title,
                                    such as  <span class="tei-q">The metrical works of Ephraim, containing 160
                                        discourses on the Church, the Mysteries of our Lord,
                                        Virginity, and against Heresies</span>. Whenever Wright gives
                                    such a title, we have tried to encode such a parent
                                         <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>, even when Wright's own numbering system did
                                    not account for it. Within this parent item, multiple levels of
                                    sub-items (each encoded with  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>) have been encoded.
                                    In this modified example there are three levels of nested
                                         <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  which are a tree model of  <span class="tei-q">The metrical

                                    <p>In some cases of such nested sub-items, Wright will only give
                                        a Roman or Greek numeral/character in lieu of an English
                                        title. This is particularly the case for lower-level nested
                                             <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  elements for which he has already given
                                        a longer descriptive title for the containing
                                             <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>. In such cases, we have pre-pended the
                                        word  <span class="tei-q">Part</span>  to the Roman or Greek character according
                                        to the following pattern  <span class="tei-q">Part c</span>. According to rules
                                        of XML, the enclosing  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  element's title is
                                        assumed to be inherited by the nested  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>. Thus
                                        the part designation is unambiguously associated with the
                                        work of which it is a part, and the  <span class="tei-gi">title</span>  element
                                        of the child  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  needs only indicate the
                                        part.

                                    <p>In rare cases, Wright describes excerpts of a single work
                                        which are broken up among non-contiguous manuscript items.
                                        That is, the work may begin, be interrupted by another
                                             <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>, and then resume. In such cases, whe
                                        have pre-pended "Continuation of " to the title of any
                                        subsequent non-contiguous instances of a work.

                                 <p>We have used a number of differen elements to encode the
                                    paratextual phrases which Wright transcribes in his catalogue.
                                    These include  <span class="tei-gi">rubric</span>,  <span class="tei-gi">incipit</span>,
                                         <span class="tei-gi">explicit</span>,  <span class="tei-gi">finalRubric</span>, and  <span class="tei-gi">quote</span>.
                                    In a related way, the  <span class="tei-gi">colophon</span>  and  <span class="tei-gi">item</span>
                                    elements are also used to encode data related to paratextual
                                    materials. As noted  <a href="#transcription">above</a>,
                                    the same principles have been used to encode the transcriptions
                                    given Wright's catalogue across all of these elements. When
                                    Wright records the location of the transcription, a
                                         <span class="tei-gi">locus</span>  element is used within each of these elements
                                    to specify the location of the component within the manuscript.
                                    Because these elements imply verbatim quotation we have not
                                    added any additional markup (e.g. quotation marks) to convey
                                    that fact. In addition all elements containing transcription of
                                    text are required to have an  <span class="tei-att">xml:lang</span>  to specify the
                                    language.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>Because of the variety of languages found in the paratextual
                                    materials of Syriac manuscripts,  <span>SMBL</span>  requires an
                                         <span class="tei-att">xml:lang</span>  where the Consolidated Schema does not.
                                    In addition, we report whatever punctuation is reported in
                                    Wright's catalogue and do not remove final punctuation for the
                                    transcriptions.
                                 </p>

                                    <p>We have used the TEI element  <span class="tei-gi">rubric</span>  to encode the
                                        original language titles given in the manuscripts and
                                        reported by Wright. While Wright may sometimes denote this
                                        Syriac title with the phrase  <span class="tei-q">entitled...</span>  or
                                             <span class="tei-q">Title:...</span>, most commonly he simply records it
                                        without any designation immediately after he provides an
                                        English language title. Sometimes Wright only provides a
                                        Syriac language title and no English translation. In both
                                        cases, we have encoded the Syriac titles reported by Wright
                                        within  <span class="tei-gi">rubric</span>  with an  <span class="tei-att">xml:lang</span>  to
                                        specify the language.

                                    <p>In some cases, a manuscript item will have multiple Syriac
                                        titles. For instance, a liturgical manuscript may include
                                        both a traditional title of the work and a title which
                                        indicates the liturgical occasion on which the work should
                                        be read. In such cases, we have encoded both the literary
                                        title and the liturgical calendar title with multiple
                                             <span class="tei-gi">rubric</span>  elements.

                                    <p>Because every  <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  element already has a
                                             <span class="tei-gi">title</span>  element where a Syriaca.org work URI
                                        could be linked, we have not linked Syriaca.org URIs to
                                        Syriac titles.

                                            opening words of the text proper, exclusive of any
                                            rubric which might precede it, of sufficient length to
                                            identify the work uniquely.</span>  In most cases, if Wright
                                        provides an incipit he also provides a rubric (though the
                                        reverse is not the case). See this example: <span class="tei-egXML">

                                    <p>In the exceedingly rare cases in which Wright records the the

                                        The explicit should not be confused with the final rubic
                                        (subscription) or colophon. The TEI defines the explicit as

                                        of one manuscript item from the next. We have encoded these

                                    <p>The TEI guidelines define a colophon as  <span class="tei-q">the original

                                        report the presence of colophons in a standardized way. He
                                        only sometimes uses the word  <span class="tei-q">colophon</span>  in the same
                                        sense as the definition of the TEI. Sometimes he uses the
                                        word to describe a doxology written by the scribe.
                                        Accordingly it has been difficult to distinguish his
                                        transcription of colophons from other marginalia and
                                        additions to the manuscripts. In our encoding, we have
                                        choosen to encode all colophons together the additions of
                                        the manuscript (see the guidelines for  <span class="tei-gi">additions</span>
                                         <a href="#additions">below</a>. We have, however, also
                                        made an effort to mark manuscripts in which either Wright
                                        reports the existence of a colophon in the sense meant by
                                        the TEI or in which we determine (based on Wright's
                                        description) that a colophon is present. In these cases, we
                                        have included a  <span class="tei-gi">colophon</span>  element in the
                                             <span class="tei-gi">msItem</span>  either as an empty element or with a
                                        prose note referring the reader to consult the additions
                                        section of the manuscript description. The inclusion of this
                                        element allows users to search for manuscripts with
                                        colophons. This is an example of that encoding:

                           the  <span class="tei-att">execution</span>  attribute, as there is no standard classification for Syriac manuscripts.
                           Nor have we used the  <span class="tei-gi">term</span>  element for further classifying
                           script or punctation characteristics. Wright's description, when present,
                           of the execution and punctuation have been recorded but left untagged.
